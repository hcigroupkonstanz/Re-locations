# Re-locations

![The Re-locations prototype from a third-person view in two different rooms. In both rooms, a computer screen and a large touchscreen are surrounded by a blue border. In room 1, a man stands in front of the large touchscreen, wearing an augmented reality head-mounted display. A white upper-body 3D avatar with a green ray hovers in front of the computer screen. In room 2, a woman sits in front of the computer screen, wearing an augmented reality head-mounted display. A white upper-body 3D avatar with a green ray hovers in front of the large touchscreen.](/Figures/Teaser.jpg)

This is an initial prototype of the Re-locations concept using the augmented reality head-mounted display Microsoft HoloLens (first generation). The prototype is part of the ISS'22 publication:
